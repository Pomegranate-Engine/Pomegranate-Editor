# Pomegranate-Engine
A simple customizable 2D Game Engine. Still WIP.

# About

![Tilemap Demo](img/tilemap_demo.png) *Tilemap Demo*

Pomegranate Engine is a 2D Game Engine written in C++ and SDL2. It is designed to be simple, easy to use, and highly customizable. 
It is currently in a very early stage of development and is not recommended for use in production.

While the engine is currently being developed on Windows. Although it should be possible to build and run on other platforms, 
because there are no windows-specific dependencies. (Although some stuff will have to be changed.)

Currently, it is being developed as a non-graphical, headless engine, in order to make sure that all features are working correctly, and are easy to use.
A graphical editor will be created in the future.

The engine comes with a Lua Wrapper so that systems/components can be written in lua. This will be more important when the graphical editor is created.
