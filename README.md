# About

The pomegranate Editor is an extension of the base Pomegranate Engine.
It is a simple 2D game engine that uses a unique Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture with more traditional Game object architecture influences. 
The engine is written in C++ and uses the SDL2 library for rendering and input handling. 
The engine is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a focus on flexibility and customization.
The engine comes with a Lua Wrapper so that systems/components can be written in lua.

The engine also comes with a custom file manager that uses a tag system to organize files.

![Hierarchy.png](img%2FHierarchy.png)
Pomegranate implements a unique Graph Hierarchy system that makes it much easier to view entity links. 
This is required because of the ECS architecture allowing for entities to be linked to multiple groups at once.
The engine is still in development and is not yet feature complete.
